# Lethal Company Mod Manager

Requires BepInEx Mod Manager for Lethal Company for the other Mods to work you can download that here:
https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/

Lethal Company Mod Manager will automatically detecte and download all mods from my github repo here https://github.com/Dev-Nitro/Lethal-Company-Mods so you should not need to redownload the Mod Manager if the mods update. I would just need to upload the updated file to that repo. Because none of the download are statically codded into the Manager
I plan on keeping the mods repo up to date with new mods or if the current ones update
