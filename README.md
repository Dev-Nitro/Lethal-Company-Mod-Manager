# Lethal Company Mod Manager

Requires DotNet 8 Runtime to work
You can download that here: https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/93961dfb-d1e0-49c8-9230-abcba1ebab5a/811ed1eb63d7652325727720edda26a8/dotnet-sdk-8.0.100-win-x64.exe

Lethal Company Mod Manager will automatically detecte and download all mods from my github repo here https://github.com/Dev-Nitro/Lethal-Company-Mods so you should not need to redownload the Mod Manager if the mods update. I would just need to upload the updated file to that repo. Because none of the download are statically codded into the Manager
I plan on keeping the mods repo up to date with new mods or if the current ones update
